## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (v18 or later recommended)
* **npm** or another package manager
* A **MongoDB** database URI (you can get a free one from [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))

### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    [git clone ](https://github.com/ImmrAD/ecommerce_spa.git)
    cd ecommerce_spa
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ecommerce-backend-ts
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Create an environment file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the `ecommerce-backend-ts` root and add the following variables:
    ```
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_strong_secret_key
    NODE_ENV=development
    ```

5.  **Seed the database with sample products:**
    This command will populate your database with sample items.
    ```bash
    npm run seed
    ```

6.  **Run the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The backend will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    From the project root, open a **new terminal** and run:
    ```bash
    cd my-react-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create an environment file:**
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the `my-react-app` root. This tells your frontend where to find the local backend API.
    ```
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
    ```

4.  **Run the frontend server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will open and be running on `http://localhost:5173`.
